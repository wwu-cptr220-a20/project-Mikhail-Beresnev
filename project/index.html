        <h2>Topic Overview</h2>
        <p>
            One of the major topics I am interested in is a self representation (as it is summer internship application
            'season' right now). One of the item I almost always see on job applicaiton is the option to list a website. 
            Often I end up linking my GitHub profile. However, I feel unless the employee is already interested in you,
            they wouldn't go through the trouble of going through any of your projects.
            <br> <br>

            Additionally, a resume is actually quite simple with limited space, may not allow one to fully express
            enough about themselves to others (on the topic, mainly employers). One current popular solution is 
            LinkedIn, which does provide access to give a much more indepth publication of ones professional experience.
            However, in LinkedIn, there is no specific to draw ones attention to specific projects one may be proud of,
            just like on GitHub.
            <br> <br>

            Thus, I feel like there is a need for a website that allows you to choose which points to emphesize. Something
            closer to an interactive resume type of website which allows you to manipulate the envirenment emphesize different points, 
            just as one may bold specific projects on ones resume. Going even further, the website would allow visual elements to be 
            included. Seeing a bunch of projects with interesting names in GitHub may be nice, but unless you go through their descriptions, 
            you would not actually know what they are about. With the visual element now an option, one could easily show an example or an 
            application of their projects.

            Below are some interesting websites that show the benefits of interactive resumes. <br>

        <h2> Potential Applications </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Resume Website Creator</h3>
                <p>
                    A website that functions similarly to a website creator, with a target of interactive resumes.
                    <br>
                    In this website, some commonly expected functions should be the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ability to upload images in assosiation to projects</li>
                        <li>The ability to expand on a projects details</li>
                        <li>No fixed location of different details</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Interactive template website</h3>
                <p>The main interest group of this website would be newer developers. Compared the first option however, 
                    this website does not allow you to directly use the website to create a website. Instead, there will be
                    a list of 'templates' for different objects one may add in to their own website. For example, a template 
                    for an expanding tag (may be something like a bullet point that is expanded for further information when
                    clicked) would include the code (html, css, js, ect.) and the general instructions for usage. This would 
                    allow beginner web developers to use different objects in their own interactive resume websites without 
                    needing to fully research and understand how every piece works.
